# Portfolio

Hello! My name is Ayan Roy. I am a data science enthusiast from India. I graduated in electronics and communication engineering and am currently pursuing my postgraduate diploma in data science from Praxis Business School. During college, I was part of my institute's entrepreneurship and development cell where I got to interact with several business and industry leaders, which helped build my business acumen. I was also a part of the robotics club and developed several projects on IoT including a Sound Pollution Monitoring System. During my third year, I was an internship trainee at Ardent Computech where I developed a machine learning project on Image Processing and Analysis. 
My academic interests include financial modelling, marketing, data analysis.

Here are some of the projects I have made. You can check more of them on my [Github Page!](https://github.com/AyanRoy22)

## 1. Room Occupancy Detection [Repo Link](https://github.com/AyanRoy22/Room_Occupancy_Detection)
This project involves analyzing sensor data from various sensors placed in a room. The objective is to develop a machine-learning model that can classify whether the room is currently occupied or unoccupied based on the sensor readings. 

- Tools used: Python <br>
- Category: Classification <br>

### Business Objectives
1. **Energy Efficiency:** Predicting room occupancy can be essential for optimizing energy consumption in buildings. By knowing when a room is unoccupied, heating, cooling, and lighting systems can be adjusted or turned off, leading to significant energy savings.
2. **Security and Safety:** Knowing if a room is occupied is important for security and safety purposes. In a smart home or office environment, this information can be used to trigger security systems or alerts when unauthorized access is detected.
3. **Resource Optimization:** Predicting occupancy helps in resource allocation. For example, in a hotel, the cleaning staff can be directed to rooms that are vacant, reducing labour costs and minimizing disturbance to guests.
4. **Occupancy Insights:** Beyond energy efficiency and security, occupancy data can provide valuable insights into space utilization. Organizations can use this information to optimize office layouts or to plan for future space requirements.

- **Models used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Ada Boost Classifier <br>
- **Best Score:** 98.02% accuracy using Random Forest Classifier <br>

## 2. Flight Fare Prediction [Repo Link](https://github.com/AyanRoy22/Flight_Ticket_Price_Prediction)
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict flight fares based on various factors such as departure location, destination, date of travel, airline, time of booking, and more. This project can be helpful for travellers, travel agencies, and airlines to estimate and plan for ticket pricing.

- Tools used: Python <br>
- Category: Regression <br>

### Business Objectives
1. The insights from this project can be used to optimize pricing strategies to maximize revenue. <br>
2. Gain a competitive edge by offering more accurate and competitive fares. <br>
3. Retain existing customers and improve their loyalty. <br>
4. Efficiently manage seat inventory <br>

- **Models used:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting <br>
- **Best Score:** A score of 0.935 (1-RMSLE), taking RMSLE as the evaluation metric, is achieved using Random Forest Regressor. <br>

## 3. Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis [Repo Link](https://github.com/AyanRoy22/RFM-Analysis)
The project focuses on utilizing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to enhance customer segmentation and develop an effective customer retention strategy for a retail store. RFM analysis is a data-driven technique that helps businesses understand customer behaviour and preferences, ultimately leading to improved marketing efforts and increased customer loyalty.

- Tools used: Python
- Category: Segmentation

### Business Objectives
1. The primary objective is to reduce customer churn and increase customer loyalty. By identifying at-risk customers and implementing effective retention strategies, businesses aim to keep more customers engaged and returning for future purchases.
2. The analysis can identify customer segments that are most valuable to the business in terms of revenue generation. This knowledge can guide resource allocation and marketing efforts.
3. The project can aim to optimize marketing budgets by tailoring campaigns to specific customer segments, resulting in better ROI.
4. The project can help the business stay agile by quickly identifying changes in customer behaviour or market trends. This allows for timely adjustments in strategies and offerings.
