# Data Science Portfolio

Hello! My name is Ayan Roy. I am a data science enthusiast from India. I did my graduation in electronics and communication engineering and currently, I am pursuing my postgraduate diploma in data science from Praxis Business School. 

Here are some of the projects I have made

## 1. Room Occupancy Detection [Repo Link](https://github.com/AyanRoy22/Room_Occupancy_Detection)
This project involves analyzing sensor data from various sensors placed in a room. The objective is to develop a machine-learning model that can classify whether the room is currently occupied or unoccupied based on the sensor readings. 

- Tools used: Python <br>
- Category: Classification <br>

### Business Objectives
1. **Energy Efficiency:** Predicting room occupancy can be essential for optimizing energy consumption in buildings. By knowing when a room is unoccupied, heating, cooling, and lighting systems can be adjusted or turned off, leading to significant energy savings.
2. **Security and Safety:** Knowing if a room is occupied is important for security and safety purposes. In a smart home or office environment, this information can be used to trigger security systems or alerts when unauthorized access is detected.
3. **Resource Optimization:** Predicting occupancy helps in resource allocation. For example, in a hotel, the cleaning staff can be directed to rooms that are vacant, reducing labor costs and minimizing disturbance to guests.
4. **Occupancy Insights:** Beyond energy efficiency and security, occupancy data can provide valuable insights into space utilization. Organizations can use this information to optimize office layouts or to plan for future space requirements.

- **Models used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Ada Boost Classifier <br>
- **Best Score:** 98.02% accuracy using Random Forest Classifier <br>

## 2. Flight Fare Prediction [Repo Link](https://github.com/AyanRoy22/Flight_Ticket_Price_Prediction)
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict flight fares based on various factors such as departure location, destination, date of travel, airline, time of booking, and more. This project can be useful for travelers, travel agencies, and airlines to estimate and plan for ticket pricing.

- Tools used: Python <br>
- Category: Regression <br>

### Business Objectives
1. The insights from this project can be used to optimize pricing strategies to maximize revenue. <br>
2. Gain a competitive edge by offering more accurate and competitive fares. <br>
3. Retain existing customers and improve their loyalty. <br>
4. Efficiently manage seat inventory <br>

- **Models used:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting <br>
- **Best Score:** A score of 0.935 (1-RMSLE), taking RMSLE as the evaluation metric, is achieved using Random Forest Regressor. <br>
