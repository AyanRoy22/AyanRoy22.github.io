# Data Science Portfolio

Hello! My name is Ayan Roy. I am a data science enthusiast from India. I did my graduation in electronics and communication engineering and currently, I am pursuing my postgraduate diploma in data science from Praxis Business School. 

Here are some of the projects I have made

## 1. Room Occupancy Detection [Repo Link](https://github.com/AyanRoy22/Room_Occupancy_Detection)
This project involves analyzing sensor data from various sensors placed in a room. The objective is to develop a machine-learning model that can classify whether the room is currently occupied or unoccupied based on the sensor readings. 

### Business Objectives
1. **Energy Efficiency:** Predicting room occupancy can be essential for optimizing energy consumption in buildings. By knowing when a room is unoccupied, heating, cooling, and lighting systems can be adjusted or turned off, leading to significant energy savings.
2. **Security and Safety:** Knowing if a room is occupied is important for security and safety purposes. In a smart home or office environment, this information can be used to trigger security systems or alerts when unauthorized access is detected.
3. **Resource Optimization:** Predicting occupancy helps in resource allocation. For example, in a hotel, the cleaning staff can be directed to rooms that are vacant, reducing labor costs and minimizing disturbance to guests.
4. **Occupancy Insights:** Beyond energy efficiency and security, occupancy data can provide valuable insights into space utilization. Organizations can use this information to optimize office layouts or to plan for future space requirements.
